<!-- ## Research Interests

* **Computational biology and drug discovery.** Focus: mechanism of ligand activation, *in silico* drug discovery, new-generation biological force fields.
* **Data-driven chemistry and geometric deep learning.** Focus: methods for large-scale simulations beyond the scope of traditional quantum chemistry.
* **Computational catalysts and reaction dynamics.** Focus: stereodivergent dual transition-metal catalysis, photoredox/transition-metal dualcatalysis, single-atom catalysis, fundamental theories of chemical reactions, etc.
* **De novo materials design.** Focus: *in silico* materials design of electro- and photochemical relevance. -->



<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
