The long-term objective of B.L.'s research has been to computationally enable molecular solutions to scientific and technological challenges in the fields of biology, materials, and catalysis. To this end, he has been working collaboratively or independently at the interface of applied molecular modeling, application-oriented method development, and deep learning, with applications to various domains of relevance. B.L. has 17 publications until Nov 2022 (8 as corresponding or (co-)1st author, 4 as 1st computational contributor in collaboration), concentrating mostly on computational molecular discovery, mechanisms of complex catalytic reactions, and materials design for optoelectronic applications. Computational biology will be B.L.'s main research focus in the upcoming years (in transition).

B.L. is currently a graduate student at Caltech (2021-present), working with pioneering theoretician Prof. [William A. Goddard, III](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/william-a-goddard) on a variety of topics in computational biology, materials, and catalysis. Current interests include:

* Development of new-generation large-scale simulation techniques
* Physics-based enzyme design
* Mechanism of ligand activation for G-protein coupled receptor
* Structural basis for complexity-building single-atom catalysis
* Computational predictions of novel organic semiconductors
* Geometric deep learning for data-driven molecular discovery

Prior to this, B.L. obtained a B.S. in Chemistry from studies in Tianjin and Nankai Universities with visits to UCLA, UC Berkeley and Caltech. He worked with Profs. [K. N. Houk](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/houk/) (UCLA), Yanfeng Dang (TJU), Dongbing Zhao (NKU) and many others on computational studies of complex catalytic reactions regarding:

* Mechanism of enzyme catalysis involved in biosynthesis
* Quantitative models of asymmetric induction in stereodivergent dual transition-metal catalysis, as well as general *in silico* toolkits for understanding stereodifferentiation
* Photochemical reactions, in particular synergistic photoredox/transition-metal catalysis and organophotoredox catalysis
* Organometallic reactions regarding: a) novel high-valent reactivities in organosilicon chemistry and strained-ring transformations, b) complex solvation effects on asymmetric induction, and c) methodological studies
* Utilization of attractive dispersion effects as a novel means of controlling catalytic complexity-building reactions such as those mentioned above
* Quasiclassical trajectory simulations for non-statistical reaction dynamics involving post-transition state bifurcation in transition metal catalysis
* Fundamental theories of chemical reactions, energy decomposition analyses and beyond

B.L. also worked with Profs. [Thomas F. Miller](https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html) (Caltech and Entos, Inc.) and Dongbing Zhao (NKU) on computational materials discovery:

* Multiscale modeling for ultralong organic room-temperature phosphorescence
* Excited-state processes of novel NBN-embedded materials
* Electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of superoxidized radical cationic dodecaborate-based clusters
* De novo generative molecular/materials discovery
* Data-driven methods for large-scale quantum yield prediction
