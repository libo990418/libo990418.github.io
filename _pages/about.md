The long-term objective of B.L.'s research has been to computationally enable molecular solutions to scientific and technological challenges in the fields of biology, materials, and catalysis. To this end, he has been working collaboratively or independently at the interface of applied molecular modeling, application-oriented method development, and deep learning, with applications to various domains of relevance.

B.L. is currently a graduate student at Caltech (2021-present), working with pioneering theoretician Prof. [William A. Goddard, III](https://www.cce.caltech.edu/people/william-a-goddard) on a variety of topics in computational biology, materials, and catalysis. Current interests include:

* Development of new-generation large-scale simulation techniques
* Physics-based enzyme design
* Mechanism of ligand activation for G-protein coupled receptor
* Structural basis for complexity-building single-atom catalysis
* Computational predictions of novel organic semiconductors
* Geometric deep learning for data-driven molecular discovery

Prior to this, B.L. obtained a B.S. in Chemistry from studies in Tianjin and Nankai Universities with visits to UCLA, UC Berkeley and Caltech. He worked with Profs. [K. N. Houk](https://www.chem.ucla.edu/houk/) (UCLA), Yanfeng Dang (TJU), Dongbing Zhao (NKU) and many others on computational studies of complex catalytic reactions regarding:

* Asymmetric induction in stereodivergent dual transition-metal catalysis
* Photochemical reactions, in particular synergistic photoredox/transition-metal catalysis and organophotoredox catalysis
* Organometallic reactions regarding both novel high-valent reactivities in strained-ring and organosilicon chemistry and methodological studies
* Reaction dynamics involving post-transition state bifurcation in transition metal catalysis
* Fundamental theories of chemical reactions, energy decomposition analyses and beyond

He also worked with Profs. [Thomas F. Miller](https://millergroup.caltech.edu/Miller_Group/Home.html) (Caltech and Entos, Inc.) and Dongbing Zhao (NKU) on computational materials discovery:

* Electrochemical and spectroscopic properties of superoxidized radical cationic dodecaborate-based clusters
* De novo generative molecular/materials discovery
* Data-driven methods for large-scale quantum yield prediction
